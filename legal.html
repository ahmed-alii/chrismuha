                <li> Muha Computer Repair is a <br> Limited Liability Company.
                <br> Muha Computer Repair currently files taxes as an LLC.
                <br> We are only allowed to provide on-site services <br> in our domestic area.
                <br> However, we can provide customer support services, remotely, as long as the services are performed in
                <br> New York State.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li> Please be aware that the prices for our services are subject to change.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li> Please also be aware that <br> due to COVID,
                <br> there are cost inflations for components.
                <br> Therefore, component prices frequently vary.
                <br> We are not the warranter for components. <br> Used/on hand components may be out of warranty.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li> We will not be held responsible if you purchase anything and you do not like it.
                <br> We always do our best to recommend purchases for our customers needs, but also within their budget.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li> Any purchases for services and/or <br> hardware from <br> Muha Computer Repair, in-person or online,
                may be subject to a transaction fee for <br> debit and credit cards.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li> We have done our best to ensure this website is accessibility and <br> user friendly.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li> We do not repair printers or re-fill ink cartridges but we can change ink cartridges or refill ink reservoirs
                <br> (printers that do not have ink cartridges have ink reservoirs).
                <br> because there is a high-risk of damaging components during servicing.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li> We do not repair broken screens for mobile devices or laptops because
                <br> components are irreplaceable due to software locks by the manufacturers.
                <br> Those software locks cannot be removed by anyone but the manufacturers.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li> Software locks limit functionality on parts. You will lose features such as adaptive brightness (True Tone).
                <br> True Tone is brightness that adapts to the lighting conditions in your environment.
                <br> Parts used, genuine or not, have been locked via software.
                <br> Software locks are in place so the consumer cannot repair their own electronics or choose their own technicians.
                <br> This may change in the near future, but currently, it remains, unfortunately…
                <br> Governments all around the world are actively working to change this from a legal perspective...
                </li>
                <br>
                <li> We do not service hardware for laptops that we assess as too complex due to insurance reasons.
                <br> Some laptops have soldered chips and/or adhesive seals to put them together, etcetera and will not be the same quality after repair.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li> We do not service liquid coolers in desktops
                <br> because of the extent of service required, and the time they take to service.
                <br> However, we would be glad to assist with other hardware and software services.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li> All times for all services rendered vary.
                <br> After hours services are charged a $100 fee in addition to any applicable service charges.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li> We are insured for slip and fall injuries, <br> as well as fire.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li> We will not be held responsible for what is reported by the customer for any online documentation submission,
                <br> including but not limited to taxation and unemployment documentation. 
                <br> We only provide the service to the customer. We fill out, print, and/or submit 
                documentation per the customers’ directions.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li> We will not be held responsible for shipping damages. However, we will insure any significantly valuable shipments with the carrier.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li> We will not be held responsible for the quality of our book prints, because we do not print them.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li> Please know that the apparel and its pricing is subject to change.
                <br> For your information, we do not develop the website for the store, and only choose the apparel.
                <br> We do not make or embroider the apparel. Therefore, we cannot control the quality or quantity of the apparel.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li> Appointments are not guaranteed to be accepted.
                <br> Availability may vary, and appointments that are/have been accepted, may have to be rescheduled.
                The customer will be responsible for any shipping and/or fuel charges for
                on-site services provided, and/or deliveries of orders.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li> We only use high-quality components for all computer hardware services.</li>
                <br>
                <li> We guarantee our services are going to satisfy you. if they do not, we have you covered, within twenty-one days, you will be provided free customer service to 
                resolve any issues with your most recent ticket; if your bill has been paid in full and you re-experience your problems or they are not resolved to your satisfaction. <i style="font-style: italic;">If we 
                informed you the services that we provided may not be as effective as you would 
                expect before we performed the services, this does not apply.</i></li>
                <br>
                <li> We will likely recommend a new desktop PC build to customers with desktops
                that have an old AMD CPU due to a
                high failure rate with AMD CPU's from that time.
                <br> It is also likely we will recommend a new computer to customers who have systems that require extensive repair.
                <br> We do this to ensure customer satisfaction with quality and pricing.
                <br> We try to do our best to assist our customers in coming to purchasing decisions that will best suit their needs.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li> We will likely recommend fan replacements for machines with extensive cigarette 
                smoke damage or thick dust that is causing fan operations to stop completely.
                <br> The reason for this is it is really thick and therefore time consuming to remove, 
                with no guarantees of repairing the fan(s).
                </li>
                <br>
                <li> Software repair and maintenance is done <br> in-person, by appointment, or remotely.
                <br> The remote sessions are secure. We use legitimate software for remote access. 
                Hackers use these software’s with malicious intents, 
                but in no way are the software’s themselves harmful to your computer, phone, tablet, etcetera.
                <br> We also offer services via shipment. <br> *Customer pays all shipping costs.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li> If any electronics are shipped to the business or the business owner without notification,
                <br> they will be returned to the sender at their expense!
                </li>
                <br>
                <li> Payment for all parts are due before a desktop build, a hardware upgrade, or
                installation will be started. Labor costs are due half up front to show that you are serious you want to proceed.
                <br> All remaining labor costs can be paid at the end of servicing, when you receive your computer.
                <!-- <br>
                <li> When we say lifetime, we mean twenty plus years from the time your computer was built.
                <br> This varies, and you may need to buy replacement components and/or accessories during that time. -->

                <li> We accept cash, debit cards, credit cards, and checks.
