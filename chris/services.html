        <p class="text-decoration-none">I, the owner, only build quality custom desktop computers for all needs. I will likely recommend new desktop PC build to customers with old AMD CPU builds due to a high failure rate with AMD chips. It is likely I will also do that for any desktop computer that requires extensive repair and or part replacement(s) that will cost the customer more than a new computer. I will likely do this for any electronic, even if I do not repair them because I am about helping people and making sure they make the best purchasing decisions and to ensure they can come to me and get reasonably and fairly charged unlike most of the competition. Part replacement will likely be my recommendation for machines heavily contaminated with smoking damage.
