                <li> Muha Computer Repair is a registered business.
                <br> Muha Computer Repair is an incorporation through the IRS and the <br> state of New York.
                <br> We are only allowed to provide on-site services
                <br> in our domestic area.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li> However, we can provide customer support services, remotely,
                <br> as long as the work is performed in
                <br> New York State.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li> Please be aware that the prices for our services are subject to change.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li> Please also be aware that <br> due to COVID,
                <br> there are cost inflations for components.
                <br> Therefore, component prices frequently vary.
                <br> We are not the warranter for components purchased from anyone/anywhere besides <br> Chris Muha or <br> Muha Computer Repair.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li> We are not responsible if you purchase anything and you do not like it.
                <br> We always do our best to recommend purchases for our customers needs, but also within their budget.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li> Any purchases for services and/or hardware from Muha Computer Repair, in-person or online,
                may be subject to a transaction fee for debit and credit cards.
                <br> We have done our best to ensure this website is accessibility and <br> user friendly.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li> We do not repair broken screens because of right to repair limitations 
                <br> for not only consumers, but for repair technicians who do not have Apple Certification
                <br> (unnecessary). 
                <br> Therefore, they do not have access to Apple’s OEM
                <br> (Original Equipment Manufacturer) <br> components,
                <br> which means any other components used, genuine or not, have been locked via software.
                <br> The components cannot be unlocked for use in Apple’s devices by anyone but Apple. 
                <br> If they are used, even if they are compatible, they simply will not be fully functional.
                <br> Governments all around the world are actively working to change this 
                <br> from a legal perspective.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li> The first reason we do not repair printers or re-fill ink 
                cartridges is there is a high-risk and inaccessible components.
                <br> That is because such hardware is built to only go together once (soldered).
                <br> There is a high-risk of damaging components during servicing. 
                <br> The second reason is because components that are 
                irreplaceable due to unavailability to anyone but the 
                manufacturers’.
                <br> *We CAN change ink cartridges.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li> We will not open a laptop beyond points that would require 
                us to significantly disassemble your system, 
                <br> to prevent accidental damage during servicing.
                <br> We would have to see your machine to be able to evaluate your system.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li> We do not service
                <br> Liquid Coolers in desktops because of the extensive amounts of time they take to service.
                <br> However, we would be glad to assist with other hardware and software services for the system.

                <li> All times for all services rendered vary.

                LATEST SECURITY PATCHES INSTALLED ON OUR SYSTEMS.
                <br> WE WILL TURN OVER COMPUTERS AND ANY OTHER ELECTRONICS TO LAW ENFORCEMENT,
                IF WE STUMBLE ACROSS ILLEGAL DATA ON YOUR COMPUTER, SUCH AS CHILD PORNOGRAPHY.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                We only build quality custom desktop computers for all needs.
                We will likely recommend a new desktop PC build to customers 
                with old AMD CPU desktops due to a high failure rate
                with AMD CPU's that are many years old. It is likely we will 
                also do that for any desktop computer that requires
                extensive repair and/or part replacement(s) that will cost the 
                customer more than a new computer. We will also likely do this 
                for any electronic, even if we do not repair them because we strive in 
                customer satisfaction. We make sure our customers
                make the best purchasing decisions and to ensure they can do 
                business with us and get reasonably and fairly charged
                unlike most of the competition.
                <br>
                </li>
                <br>
                <li> Fan replacement(s) will likely be our recommendation 
                for machines with extensive cigarette smoke damage.
                <br> The reason for this is it is really thick and therefore time consuming to remove, 
                with no guarantees of repairing the fan(s).
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                Software repair and maintenance is done <br> in-person, by appointment, or remotely.
                <br> The remote sessions are secure. We use legitimate software for remote access. 
                Hackers use these softwares with malicious intents, 
                but in no way are the softwares themselves harmful to your computer, phone, tablet, etcetera.
                <br> We also offer services via shipment. <br> *Customer pays all shipping.

                all remaining labor costs can
                be paid at the end of the job. We accept cash, debit cards, credit cards, and checks. 
                The time for each job varies, please understand
