                <li> Please also be aware that <br> due to COVID,
                <br> there are cost inflations for components.
                <br> Therefore, component prices frequently vary.

                <br>
                <li> WE DO NOT REPAIR PRINTERS OR RE-FILL INK CARTRIDGES BUT WE CAN CHANGE INK CARTRIDGES OR REFILL INK RESERVOIRS
                <br> (PRINTERS THAT DO NOT HAVE INK CARTRIDGES HAVE INK RESERVOIRS).
                <br> BECAUSE THERE IS A HIGH-RISK OF DAMAGING COMPONENTS DURING SERVICING.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li> WE DO NOT REPAIR BROKEN SCREENS FOR MOBILE DEVICES, INCLUDING TABLETS AND 2 IN 1 TABLET/LAPTOPS BECAUSE
                <br> COMPONENTS ARE IRREPLACEABLE DUE TO SOFTWARE LOCKS.
                <br> THOSE SOFTWARE LOCKS CANNOT BE REMOVED BY ANYONE BUT THE MANUFACTURERS’.

                <br>
                <li> WE DO NOT SERVICE APPLE COMPUTERS DUE TO SOFTWARE LOCKS PLACED BY APPLE LIMITING
                FUNCTIONALITY ON PARTS. SOFTWARE LOCKS ARE IN PLACE SO THE CONSUMER CANNOT REPAIR THEIR OWN ELECTRONICS OR CHOOSE THEIR OWN TECHNICIANS.
                <br> THIS MAY CHANGE IN THE NEAR FUTURE, BUT CURRENTLY, IT REMAINS, UNFORTUNATELY…

                <br>
                <li> WE DO NOT SERVICE HARDWARE FOR LAPTOPS THAT WE ASSESS AS TOO COMPLEX DUE TO INSURANCE REASONS.
                <br> SOME LAPTOPS HAVE SOLDERED CHIPS AND/OR ADHESIVE SEALS TO PUT THEM TOGETHER, ETCETERA.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li> WE DO NOT SERVICE LIQUID COOLERS IN DESKTOPS
                <br> BECAUSE OF THE EXTENT OF SERVICE REQUIRED, AND THE TIME THEY TAKE TO SERVICE.
                <br> HOWEVER, WE WOULD BE GLAD TO ASSIST WITH OTHER HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE SERVICES.

                <br>
                <li>WE GUARANTEE OUR SERVICES ARE GOING TO SATISFY YOU. IF THEY DO NOT, WE HAVE YOU COVERED, WITHIN TWENTY-ONE DAYS, YOU WILL BE PROVIDED FREE CUSTOMER SERVICE TO 
                RESOLVE ANY ISSUES WITH YOUR MOST RECENT TICKET; IF YOUR BILL HAS BEEN PAID IN FULL AND YOU RE-EXPERIENCE YOUR PROBLEMS OR THEY ARE NOT RESOLVED TO YOUR SATISFACTION. <i style="font-style: italic;">IF WE 
                INFORMED YOU THE SERVICES THAT WE PROVIDED MAY NOT BE AS EFFECTIVE AS YOU WOULD

                <br>
                <li> We will likely recommend a new desktop PC build to customers with desktops
                that have an old AMD CPU due to a
                high failure rate with AMD CPU's from that time.
                <br> It is also likely we will recommend a new computer to customers who have systems that require extensive repair.
                <br> We do this to ensure customer satisfaction with quality and pricing.
                <br> We try to do our best to assist our customers in coming to purchasing decisions that will best suit their needs.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li> WE WILL LIKELY RECOMMEND FAN REPLACEMENTS FOR MACHINES WITH EXTENSIVE CIGARETTE 
                SMOKE DAMAGE OR THICK DUST THAT IS CAUSING FAN OPERATIONS TO STOP COMPLETELY.
                <br> The reason for this is it is really thick and therefore time consuming to remove, 
                with no guarantees of repairing the fan(s).
                </li>
                <br>
                <li> Software repair and maintenance is done <br> in-person, by appointment, or remotely.
